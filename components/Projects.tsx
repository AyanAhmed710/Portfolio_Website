        fullDesc: "Designed and built the entire AI/ML layer for TradeFinlytix, an AI-powered stock analysis platform for the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX).\n\nSystem 1 — Stacked Ensemble Engine: Three-model stack (XGBoost + LightGBM + LSTM) with a Ridge meta-learner classifies trade signals (buy / hold / trim / sell) with a confidence score. Inputs are 59 engineered technical features — price structure, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, volume metrics, and cross-sectional peer ranks. SHAP TreeExplainer surfaces the top-10 directional feature drivers per prediction.\n\nSystem 2 — NHITS Forecaster: Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series (NeuralForecast / PyTorch Lightning) produces a 50-day closing price forecast using the same 59 features plus 4 market-wide exogenous signals. Forecasts are cached per symbol (1-hour TTL).\n\nSystem 3 — Stock RAG Pipeline: LangChain + FAISS pipeline with an intelligent query router that dynamically selects from six retrieval techniques — Query Rewriting, Step-Back Prompting, Multi-Query, HyDE, Decomposition, and RAG Fusion. Cost-aware LLM routing sends cheap operations to Groq (LLaMA 3.1-8B) and final generation to GPT-4o-mini. Contextual compression reduces token cost before final generation.\n\nSystem 4 — Self-RAG News Intelligence: Scrapes live PSX announcements via Playwright (headless Chromium), evaluates relevance (IsRel), hallucination (IsSup), and utility (IsUse) with GPT-4o-mini, downloads top PDFs, and generates a structured market briefing. Also built: Audit Log RAG (security analyst queries over embedded logs with Groq LLaMA 3.3-70B) and Behavioral Anomaly Detection (390-dim vectors + IsolationForest, per-user Redis storage).",

Descriptions are extracted from the side panel within the search-results page — keeping the entire scrape in a single tab to stay within Railway's 512 MB RAM limit.\n\nRAG pipeline: For each job, OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 embeds the job description and the user's project pool. ChromaDB retrieves the 4 most semantically relevant projects. GPT-4.1-mini (via LangChain) rewrites those projects and the About/Summary section with job-specific ATS keywords. Project rewriting and About rewriting run concurrently via LangChain RunnableParallel, cutting per-job processing time roughly in half.\n\nPDF generation: ReportLab overlays the rewritten content onto a PDF resume template. pypdf handles reading and page merging.\n\nReal-time UX: FastAPI streams live pipeline logs to the browser over Server-Sent Events (SSE) from background threads — no polling, no page refresh.

The LLM autonomously decides which of 6 tools to invoke and in what order — parse_intent, search_providers, rank_providers, scrape_realtime_providers (Nominatim + Overpass API + DuckDuckGo fallback), search_web_providers, and ask_clarification. Every tool call is traced with step number, name, args, result summary, duration_ms, and execution status.\n\n5 Specialized Agents: Intent Parser (keyword extraction, no LLM for speed) → Provider Search (4-stage filter on 50 providers) → Ranking Engine (35% Haversine distance + 35% rating + 20% price fit + 10% review count, with Groq-generated per-provider reasons) → Booking Simulator (SQLite, UUID-based BK-XXXX-KHI IDs) → Follow-Up Planner (Groq generates 3 bilingual SMS / push / in-app follow-up messages).\n\nVoice AI: VAPI integration triggers outbound AI phone calls to providers in bilingual Urdu/English across 3 call types — Inquiry, Confirmation, and Follow-Up. transcript_analyzer.py classifies call outcomes: accepted / reschedule_requested / rejected / no_answer.\n\nReal-Time Transparency: FastAPI SSE endpoint streams live tool-call events (agent_start, agent_done, complete) to the React Native/Expo mobile app, where each reasoning step animates in sequence — making the agentic process fully visible to the user.",
